            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
            My name is Gianna Fernandez and I am currently a second-year
              undergraduate student at the University of Florida pursuing a
              Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering. I am also
              pursuing a minor in Sales Engineering and the University of
              Florida’s Artificial Intelligence Certificate. Currently I am
              seeking an internship for summer of 2025. I am passionate about
              traveling, dancing, sports, and nature. My ethnic background is
              Hispanic and Greek-Cypriot. My Cuban family eats lechon, dances to
              Spanish music, and plays dominos until the sun rises. Growing up
              in Miami felt like I was in a Cuban hub where I could freely swap
              between English and Spanish. However, when I moved from Miami, I
              realized I took my Cuban culture for granted. I discovered that
              being Hispanic is a minority when looking for peers to converse in
              Spanish or finding my favorite foods in the small international
              section of the grocery store. When my family gathers, the Cuban
              side dances Salsa, and my Greek side dances the Kalamatiano. To
              commemorate my Cypriot heritage, I have been dancing in Greek
              festivals since I was three.

              Throughout high school and college, I have competed in the U.S.’s
              most prestigious traditional Greek folkloric dance forum: the
              Hellenic Dance Festival (HDF). Since scores are based on
              authenticity, I research the unique culture, dances, and costumes
              of several regions of Greece. To prepare for this national event,
              I spend countless hours perfecting each dance move, so much so
              that blisters form on my feet and holes appear at the bottoms of
              my shoes even before the judges ever see me perform. As a result
              of our extensive training, my team has won several medals at HDF.
              I celebrate and identify with my Greek and Hispanic cultures
              equally. Depending on who I am talking to, I may greet them by
              saying “yiasou” or ”hola” instead of “hello”.

              To stay connected with my heritage, I am actively a part of the
              Cuban American Student Association in addition to being the
              founder and president of the Greek American Student Association.
              This portfolio is designed to showcase my global academic,
              personal, and professional experiences as the final component of
              the International Scholars Program at the University of Florida,
              and I invite you to browse through it to see all I have learned
              throughout my time in the program so far.
