                In 2023 I re-established the Greek American Student Association
                (GASA for short) after 5 years of it being inactive at the
                University of Florida due to Covid. In the short time it has
                been active we have had many socials, and had the GASA dance
                troupe perform traditional Greek dances at Europe day. Through
                this club I have learned leadership skills, and many things
                about my own culture I previously did not know from creating fun
                and unique events based around my culture.

              <p>
                I have created many connections with others in the Cuban
                American Student Association, connected with my own culture, and
                learned about the linguistic differences between other hispanic
                cultures. I have made many professional connections through this
                club.

                From a young age I would dance salsa with my dad, and he never
                learned how to dance casino style. He encouraged me to join
                Gator Salsa to learn the things he did not so that I may be able
                to teach him and other friends how to do it. It has been a great
                experience and allowed me to create a unique collaboration for
                people at Gator Salsa to learn traditional Greek dancing.

                Open Source Code has encouraged me to be constantly learning
                more about coding, and sharpening my skills. It promotes
                camaraderie with open source group coding projects. Aside from
                coding I have also had the privilege of joining their intramural
                soccer teams to extend the fun both inside and outside of the
                classroom.
